## Introduction
In this work, we focus on building a unified model capable of handling multiple degradation types within a single framework. Specifically, we aim to restore two distinct types of degraded images (snow and rain) using a shared network architecture. To address the challenge of multi-degradation restoration, we modify the components and modules of the PromptIR architecture, a state-of-the-art prompt-based image restoration model. 
My code is base on git PromptIR: https://github.com/va1shn9v/PromptIR.git
